"""
Batch Queue Processor - Constant GPU Load Processing

This module provides a batch processing strategy that maintains constant GPU
utilization by pre-generating all prompts and queuing them continuously to
the AI server.

Key Features:
- Pre-generates all prompts before any AI execution
- Queues all requests rapidly to keep GPU fully loaded
- Eliminates power oscillations that cause coil whine
- Thread-safe with checkpoint and failure tracking support
- Maps results back to jobs after completion

Architecture:
1. Prompt Generation Phase: Creates all prompts upfront
2. Execution Phase: Queues all AI requests with minimal delays
3. Result Mapping Phase: Maps responses back to original jobs
